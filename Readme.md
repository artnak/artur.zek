## Building with Docker

Check the [DOCKER.md](https://github.com/artnak/artur.zek/blob/master/DOCKER.md) file.

## Building locally

Deployment-ready files are contained in the `build` directory.

To work on the project double-click `Preview on this Computer`

To publish to the internet double-click `Publish to www.zek.si`

To work on the website:

    $ make dev-server
    
## Requirements for OS X

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/
) & *XCode Command Line Tools* installed.

Download Node.js & NPM from the Node homepage: https://nodejs.org/en/

If the `make build` command fails, you might need to install XCode Command Line Developer Tools first:

    $ xcode-select --install
