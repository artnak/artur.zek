Deployment-ready files are contained in the `build` directory.

To work on the project run these commands:

    $ npm install
    $ node build.js

Or simply:

    $ make build
    
## Requirements for OS X

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/
) & *XCode Command Line Tools* installed.

Download Node.js & NPM from the Node homepage: https://nodejs.org/en/

If the `make build` command fails, you might need to install XCode Command Line Developer Tools first:

    $ xcode-select --install
