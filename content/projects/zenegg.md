We have a lot of experience with crowdfunding campaigns and helped many crowdfunders to surpass their goals ($1M till date) but we never owned any of their products or even helped them build it from scratch. We were always hired solely to focus on design and communication. That all changed when Gašper came into our lives.

This was our first crowdfunding end-to-end campaign we built - from idea to sustainable business. On January 13, 2015 Zen Egg successfully raised $111.144 with 2.966 backers (50 times more than our target goal).

## Product Design: How a random sketch started a new chapter

Gašper Premože is a brilliant product designer, with more than 10 years of experience in designing products. One day he was asked to do a massage product for a client where he included a wooden egg in one of his presentations. This idea seemed a bit out of the ordinary and didn’t match the brief. But he stayed up all night thinking there is something more to this. Leftover sketches started to blossom into a whole new concept.

He stopped at our office to validate his idea. Knowing Gašper's previous work, we saw potential that needed polishing. With our previous experiences and knowledge with Kickstarter protocols and marketplace, we assembled the team for his campaign.

The prototype of an wooden egg was made very soon and brought to our meetings. People just couldn't put their hands off it. Together we iterated on functionality in search of a unique value proposition suitable for the market. By deciding that the object has to be balanced and must return to its upright position, we evolved the initial idea from a stress reliever into a collectable desk totem with a story. We just needed to check how much the production line would cost us and we were ready for our campaign.

## Communication strategy and early stages

The strategy was created in sync with the product development. The research brought results of potential customers and defined our market size. We compared the crowdfunding categories and scanned our competitors to get to product market fit. 

We made a few early mistakes while looking for the right language with some clumsy descriptions but we did stay true to our defined communication strategy and its core values. It was substantial that the product had no bullshit features and no false promises. It's a wooden egg and Gašper is promoting mindfulness. This is his noble view of the world. Our job on the other side was to promote the shit out of it. Sometimes this two values were in conflict, but it was vital for us that we stayed grounded.

The next step was even more important - the community. Building a community is the hardest part. We've entered Slovenia’s second Kickstarter generation wave. Nobody really expected from previous Slovenian backers to support our local stories anymore. Those days are over and we needed a new hype boost.

We had a launch event in our coworking space (Poligon, Ljubljana). That set an introduction to our story and the media did a piece about us. That's not enough off course. We had to continue trending. 29 days left of campaigning.

## Brand communication: Overpolishing visual language is not always in line with the product's vibe 

The brand was carefully communicating bottom-up economy - one man’s path into the business world. This is quite a common way of presenting projects but we also paid attention to details with micro visual language. For instance - the logo illustrates the story with a brush combining Zen symbol, shape of an egg and Ouroboros. We intentionally under-designed the overall tone with sloppy handwritting vibe of a common individual. The whole atmosphere was explained through images and indicated product's value propositions but the overall tone was Gašper's unconventional speech and content.

Which brings us to video - the most important component for our communication. We stayed up late hours talking it through. It had to communicate Gašper’s story and it had to be honest. This was a huge responsibility for us because a friend's name was on stake. After long consideration we made a script that we all agreed upon and went on shooting it. Gašper was on fire and did some impro.

## On the Field: Hearing backer's expectations and acting agile


The production line's cost was around $2000 and we didn’t want to set our goal higher than that. It would appear greedy. Although in case of only reaching that goal, our team would lose $20.000 spent in services (research, product design, branding, video, communication, management). That’s the risk we took as a crew. It was also a good time to test our hypothesis. It went even better than we expected because Gašper truly is a genuine character.

## Post-campaign: It's not over until you deliver all the pre-orders

After campaign succeded we had to deliver all the goods. We had a few problems with the production line. A lot of first batches were thrown away because Gašper was not satisfied with the execution. He spent weeks with manufacturers and taught them how to produce the perfectly balanced wooden egg. In the end he finally got some rest. It was a crazy chapter in his life.

On the business side - the most important thing for us was using Fatsell to continue taking pre-orders on our webpage. Even though the campaign stopped on Kickstarter it didn’t stop our business. The backer's survey was also easier to manage because we've imported CSV from Kickstarter to Fatsell and whenever we have to ship we often use filtering (orders by customer, products and country) because it saves so much time.

Today, ZenEgg is an online business searching for the right retailers to expand. We even tried Facebook ads and a bit of email marketing. This is handled very careful. We don't want to go against the brand values. We want to stay true to the core idea - Zen. Business has to be sustainable but not aggressive.

## That feels gud-to touch. And... it has a pleasant smell
{{ spacer }}

Gašper's unique expression and our early communication had it's flaws but we'd just like to say that Gašper is a calm, meditating dude. His appearance is truthful and so is his product. ZenEgg is a collectable totem just like the fidget spinner. Only it's a wooden egg that looks nice. And has a pleasant smell.

We usually collect pretty things because we're fond of aesthetics. The objects around us evoke memories or feelings. Instead of just looking at it as a cheap marketing trick, Gašper's product just wants to remind us of the philosophy of peace and self respect. That's his story. And we think it's admirable.
