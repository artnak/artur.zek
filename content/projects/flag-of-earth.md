# We are creating visual language that supports the idea of becoming Type I civilization.

"These civilizations can effectively control the entire resources of their planet; they can predict weather patterns and earthquakes very accurately, and even control them using artificially induced greenhouse effects or space-based lasers. A Type 1 Civilization could conceivably halt an ice-age." Dr. Michio Kaku

The symbol derives from logic and is not culturally biased. The Earth's flag is part of our solar system flags. By using the symbol, we are using current values (love, knowledge, responsibility and evolution) to reach Type I civilization.

## Together as humans we’re facing climate change, wars, pollution, economic inequality, hate crimes, violation of civil rights, government distrust, natural resource depletion and more of horrendous issues that need to be resolved in order to reach the next state of human civilization.

Design logic from the Flag of Earth stays the same and can be applied on all planet's flags from our Solar system. The distance from the Sun and the number of the moons of course changes. 

{{> label title="" description="Example: Saturn has 53 moons. None of them should be excluded, so they are presented equally. " }}

The flag's designs can change in relation to new discoveries.

## Critique
Having so many flags offers a potential scenario for dividing us once more. Evolving into [Type II civilization](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Kardashev_scale) would be reasonable as one solar system and not as one of the planets.

Designed symbols and flags are in order to unify common grounds and bring peace on the Planet. Solar flag will be here to remind us that even living on other planets - we are united as one.

# History

The Flag of Earth was redesigned once more by Miha Artnak & Srđan Prodanović from Studio People in January, 2013.

While working on a design project a question sparked our imagination. What would our planet's flag look like? We didn't do any research, we just separately drew what we thought was the logical visual representation. We immediately noticed that we had an identical solution. Only this drove us into research. We found out there were few attempts already put to practice. The logic of our predecessors was the same. Earth as a planet in our solar system. We even found almost exact design being made in 1979 by James W. Cadle (USA). This proved we were on a right path. Having the same ideas and opinions about the visual representation of our homeland in a different time and place brought us closer also culturally.

I continued with the research and designed it into a system. This article was published on 1st of September, 2017.

# Terms of agreement 

Ideas spread under the flags are just opinions. Trolling, hate speech, bullshit, dumb stuff and manipulation should not sabotage the faith in humanity or destroy the symbol. The symbol is our mirror. We are culturally, mentally and politically diverse and most of the time just don’t agree. This time we need to step together as one and start rewriting our future.
