# Project Flag of Earth started as an idea of a united world reaching global peace and accepting our differences. 

Together as humans we’re facing climate change, wars, pollution, economic inequality, hate crimes, violation of civil rights, government distrust, natural resource depletion and more of horrendous issues that need to be resolved in order to reach a [Type I civilization](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Kardashev_scale). 

We need to believe that the future is bright for humankind. We have to. We are all humans. We all think, feel and dream. The solution is in being proactive in society. We need to help each other, organize and discuss how to reach that goal.

# Do we - who consider ourselves as the citizens of the world - have our own symbol?

On January, 2013 we separately drew what we thought was the logical visual representation for our kind. Results were visually identical. Only then we did the research. We found out there were few attempts already put to practice. The logic of our predecessors was the same. Earth as a planet in our solar system. We even found almost exact design being made in 1979 by James W. Cadle (USA). This proved we were on a right path. Having the same thoughts and opinions about the visual representation of our homeland in different time and place brought us closer also culturally.

# “In order to consider ourselves as humanity, instead of us and them, this was one of the attempts to reach that goal. It was one of new year’s resolutions in designing politics with Srdjan. Eventually everyone should use the symbol. The goal is united love, but we’ll see what will it stand for in the future. Will it reflect our victory or our failure as humankind? The project is still in development.”

[Current version of the Flag of Earth](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xwdakz451nragfz/zastava-tisk.pdf?dl=0) was made in 2013 by Miha Artnak and Srđan Prodanović from design studio [People](https://people.ooo/).

## Important takeaway 
 Ideas spread under the flag are just opinions. Trolling, hate speech, bullshit, dumb stuff and manipulation should not sabotage the faith in humanity or destroy the symbol. The symbol is our mirror. We are culturally, mentally and politically diverse and don’t agree on a lot of stuff. But sometimes we do need to step together as one.

Design logic from the Flag of Earth stays the same and can be applied within all planet's flags in our Solar system. The distance from the Sun and the number of the moons of course changes. Example: Saturn has 53 moons. None of them should be excluded, so they are presented equally (like States).

Having so many flags offers a potential scenario for dividing us once more. Evolving into [Type II civilization](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Kardashev_scale) would be reasonable as one solar system and not as one of the planets.

 Designed symbols and flags are in order to unify common grounds and bring peace on the Planet. Solar flag is here to remind us that even on other planets we're united as one.
