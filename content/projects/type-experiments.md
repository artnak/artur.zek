Typography is everywhere. In fact, everything is everywhere. All you have to do is pay attention. Imagination is boundless. However, there are some rules that apply in the infinite space. Once we attach the incessantly upgrading semantics to art theory, we can quickly recognize a face or a letter in a wall stain. The context and visual education, stemming from pictograms, silhouettes and basic shapes, both continue a never-ending story of the visual. One must not forget about the importance of cultural history and location. If we cannot see anything in the stain, it does not mean the same applies for someone from a different environment. When it comes to type, we are faced with an additional challenge, for it is never only about the visual knowledge, but also the knowledge on meaning and contents. In pages to come, I address type analysis, which I transform into shapes and back to letters. I have constructed a unique categorization system, for which I cannot claim to be universal. However, it does in fact make a great tool when exploring for ideas, because it saves time. I take on basic parts of the letter as well as the entire form; I add style or context, sometimes effects. This is of course display typography; it can be easily recognized from the expressive medium, but prior to that an expressive ego is sought for: the question of resolving the form.

# 3D serif

Serifs play an important historical role and exude a particular impression and stability in letters. This experiment addresses the characteristics of the third dimension and not only the extrusion from 2d. This is why the serifs are faced towards us; this en face perspective appears to be sans, gaining added value with the impression obtained through further observation of the object from multiple angles. In this case, they play an even greater role in stability, because the letters have a substantially more stable balance.

# Simulation of dimension

The concept of dimension simulation draws on the fact that dimension is under usual circumstances simulated on two-dimensional surfaces with the aim to obtain a threedimensional effect. However, this experiment attempts the opposite, namely the challenge of transforming a threedimensional object into its two-dimensional counterpart. Taking a further step, the seemingly two-dimensional object once again imitates the third dimension with the use of geometrized two-dimensional highlights. 2D wannabe 3D = 3D.

# Stretching

In typography, there are several rules applying to size modification. When it comes to stretching, the process is usually done proportionally. The featured examples show the use of stretching without regard to proportionality; the upper is extended horizontally, the lower vertically, still following certain rules and limitations.

# Helvetica Pointed

When it comes to display fonts, readability plays a more important role than legibility. The concept of distinguishability is not as critical as it is with typefaces, designed for body text. Display fonts are key factors of recognizability; this particular font is extremely widespread, mainly because of its “bullet-proof” character and accessibility. This enables a type designer to seek new features without the trouble of creating a completely new typeface. The application of the pointed terminal is more a presentation of a new type feature than merely a twist on the existing typeface. With the application of the pointed terminal, the stroke, loop and shoulder of a type stay unchanged. However, the apex and the vertex, defined as the meeting point of two strokes, differ and fail to remain uniform. The pointed effect could not be applied with all meeting points, and was, in those cases substituted with a clipped edge. The terminals of letters with a loop undergo some optical changes. The original font is made by Max Miedinger, copyright held by Linotype.

# Try Angles

With the use of grid triangles, an entire serif typeface family can be produced. By adding the modules, the serifs change their character; once removed, they disappear without affecting the basic letters or their standard form. However minimal its application might be, it is interesting how much of an impact the module produces, for it defines the distingishability among different serifs, allowing for flexibility in the modularly-based information Try Angles Small Caps technology system.

# Use of modular system

In a system of typograms, a module is with regards to its interface a well-defined component, which can be interchanged without disassembly. However, with semantically relevant modules, this no longer holds true; they cannot be substituted for the simple fact that they are modules themselves. Their use can be limited to one element or can comprise the entire character.

The grid with a continuing internal contour provides an unexpected result. When broken down into individual contours, they become increasingly undistinguishable to the point of complete discrepancy, not only visually but also semantically.

# Use of negative space

This spread features examples of the use of negative space. They rely on the application of typical as well as untypical negative space elements; circles, diamonds, arrows, triangles etc. The homogeneity of the examples on the left differs from that of the upper example; the latter is primarily perceived as merely a set of shapes, it is not until later that the lettering can be distinguished and connected into a single word. The modularity of the examples, presented on the left is uniform; this is true for both the positive and the negative space. The base of all the left typograms is a rectangular; the negative spaces vary, but they do however follow certain rules, such as flipping, reflexivity and clipping. The result of this process provides a different character to the typograms, which can be enhanced by adding effects, color or hue.

# Mood

The shaping of letters conveys a particular conotation, which can be amplified or dissolved within a given context or with the use of different effects. The typogram itself changes character and gives off a specific impression.

# Analphabet X

Distance increase between separate vertical elements of a character results in an optical illusion of thinness. When strokes are positioned closely together, they appear bold. This feature opposes the simple logic of typeface standards; thinness is no longer a mean of economizing with space, for it is actually rendered wider than bold typeface. The two columns, presented on the left provide a comparison; the standard treatment is given in the right column, the experiment in the left one.

# Analphabet Y

This section features a different attempt at the previous experiment. Rather than stretching the type on the horizontal axis, this experiment makes use of the vertical direction by breaking the type into horizontal parcels. Resulting in condensity, the typeface is less applicable than the previous one: once extended upwards, it begins to lack in readability. Not so much focused on functionality, this type has a more prominent display feature.

# Analphabet XY

A fusion of the two previously attempted experiments generates an interesting result. The outcome of simultaneous horizontal and vertical division into parcels is in this case a pixel. This process yields an intriguing effect: at times, the modification deforms the fonts to the extent of apparent nonrelatedness to the base font. The process presented on the left demonstrates the movement of the pixels without resizing them: an increased separation of the pixels renders the font larger.
